# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware ‚Äì PCs
2. Anaconda ‚Äì Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
```
(i) To find L and U matrix
1.Input Matrix: Read the square matrix (or rectangular matrix) input from the user.
2.Convert to NumPy Array: Parse the input into a NumPy array for efficient numerical computations.
3.Perform LU Decomposition: Use the scipy.linalg.lu function to compute the LU decomposition, yielding the permutation matrix (P), lower triangular matrix (L), and upper triangular matrix (U).
4.Extract L and U Matrices: Ignore the permutation matrix and extract the L and U matrices from the decomposition result.
5.Output the L Matrix: Print the L (lower triangular) matrix.
6.Output the U Matrix: Print the U (upper triangular) matrix.
7.End Program: Ensure the program ends cleanly after displaying the results.
```
```
(ii) To find the LU Decomposition of the matrix

1.Input Matrix and Vector: Read the coefficient matrix and the right-hand-side vector 
b from the user.
2.Convert to NumPy Arrays: Parse both the matrix and vector inputs into NumPy arrays for numerical processing.
3.Perform LU Factorization: Use scipy.linalg.lu_factor to compute the LU decomposition of the matrix.
4.Solve the System: Pass the LU decomposition result and the vector 
ùëè to scipy.linalg.lu_solve to solve the system of equations.
5.Extract Solution: Obtain the solution vector from the output of lu_solve.
6.Output Solution: Print the solution vector, representing the values of the unknowns.
7.End Program: Ensure the program concludes after displaying the solution
